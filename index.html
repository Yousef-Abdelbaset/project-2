              Right from the beginning of human settlement, a lot of people came up with ideas, philosophies, beliefs,
              experiments, research, redesigning of thoughts, and surveys to bring myths to reality. People contributed
              for
              science to study different aspects of nature to prosper mankind. These genius minds put a keen interest on
              every phenomenon right from when they were kids. The zeal, passion, dedication, hard work and the effort
              they
              put in their work helped them discover something new about the world we live in.
              The world today dwells in the abode of scientific advancement in different sectors of medical science,
              engineering and technology because of these scientists. The present picture of the world that we see would
              not
              have transformed without the contribution of these great personalities. Great philosophers and masterminds
              that existed in the ancient Greek era to the present day scientists, we’ve seen inexplicable abilities
              that
              helped us define our existence and human life.

              Their names are engraved in the sands of time for their work in the welfare of mankind with different
              inventions that has made our modern lives easy. The following list commemorates 10 of the greatest
              scientists
              we’ve ever seen who changed the world.

              lbert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family
              moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to
              Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal
              Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he
              gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he
              accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s
              degree.
              During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and
              in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in
              1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a
              similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in
              the University of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he
              renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor
              of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post
              in 1945.

              After World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement, he was offered the
              Presidency of the State of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in
              establishing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

              Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve
              them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He
              regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.

              At the start of his scientific work, Einstein realized the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and his
              special theory of relativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of
              the electromagnetic field. He dealt with classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which
              they were merged with quantum theory: this led to an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. He
              investigated the thermal properties of light with a low radiation density and his observations laid the
              foundation of the photon theory of light.

              In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct interpretation of the special theory of
              relativity must also furnish a theory of gravitation and in 1916 he published his paper on the general
              theory of relativity. During this time he also contributed to the problems of the theory of radiation and
              statistical mechanics.
              In the 1920s, Einstein embarked on the construction of unified field theories, although he continued to
              work
              on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, and he persevered with this work in America. He
              contributed to statistical mechanics by his development of the quantum theory of a monatomic gas and he
              has
              also accomplished valuable work in connection with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic
              cosmology.

              After his retirement he continued to work towards the unification of the basic concepts of physics, taking
              the opposite approach, geometrisation, to the majority of physicists.

              Einstein’s researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory
              of
              Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916),
              Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his
              non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later
              Years
              (1950) are perhaps the most important.

              Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine and philosophy from many European
              and American universities. During the 1920’s he lectured in Europe, America and the Far East, and he was
              awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world. He gained
              numerous awards in recognition of his work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in
              1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935.

              Einstein’s gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellectual solitude and, for relaxation,
              music played an important part in his life. He married Mileva Maric in 1903 and they had a daughter and
              two
              sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who
              died in 1936. He died on April 18, 1955 at Princeton, New Jersey.

              Despite her French name, Marie Curie’s story didn’t start in France. Her road to Paris and success was a
              hard one, as equally worthy of admiration as her scientific accomplishments.

              Born Maria Salomea Sklodowska in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, she faced some daunting hurdles, both because of
              her gender and her family’s poverty, which stemmed from the political turmoil at the time. Her parents,
              deeply patriotic Poles, lost most of their money supporting their homeland in its struggle for
              independence from Russian, Austrian and Prussian regimes. Her father, a math and physics professor, and
              her mother, headmistress of a respected boarding school in Russian-occupied Warsaw, instilled in their
              five kids a love of learning. They also imbued them with an appreciation of Polish culture, which the
              Russian government discouraged.

              When Curie and her three sisters finished regular schooling, they couldn’t carry on with higher education
              like their brother. The local university didn’t let women enroll, and their family didn’t have the money
              to send them abroad. Their only options were to marry or become governesses. Curie and her sister
              Bronislawa found another way.

              The pair took up with a secret organization called Flying University, or sometimes Floating University.
              Fittingly, given the English abbreviation, the point of FU was to stick it to the Russian government and
              provide a pro-Polish education, in Polish — expressly forbidden in Russian-controlled Poland.

              Eventually, the sisters hatched a plan that would help them both get the higher education they so
              desperately wanted. Curie would work as a governess and support Bronislawa’s medical school studies. Then,
              Bronislawa would return the favor once she was established. Curie endured years of misery as a governess,
              but the plan worked. In 1891, she packed her bags and headed to Paris and her bright future.

              At the University of Paris, Curie was inspired by French physicist Henri Becquerel. In 1896, he discovered
              that uranium emitted something that looked an awful lot like — but not quite the same as — X-rays, which
              had been discovered only the year before. Intrigued, Curie decided to explore uranium and its mysterious
              rays as a Ph.D. thesis topic.

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="section-p-2" style="color: aliceblue;">
            <p class="py-5">
              Eventually, she realized whatever was producing these rays was happening at an atomic level, an important
              first step to discovering that atoms weren’t the smallest form of matter. It was a defining moment for
              what Curie would eventually call radioactivity.

              Around the same time, Curie met and married her French husband, Pierre, an accomplished physicist who
              abandoned his own work and joined his wife’s research. The two started examining minerals containing
              uranium and pitchblende, a uranium-rich ore, and realized the latter was four times more radioactive than
              pure uranium. They reasoned some other element must be in the mix, sending those radioactive levels
              through the roof. And they were right: After processing literally tons of pitchblende, they discovered a
              new element and named it polonium, after Marie’s native Poland.

              They published a paper in July 1898, revealing the find. And just five months later, they announced their
              discovery of yet another element, radium, found in trace amounts in uranium ore.

              In 1903, Curie, her husband and Becquerel won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on radioactivity,
              making Curie the first woman to win a Nobel.

              Tragedy struck just three years later. Pierre, who had recently accepted a professorship at the University
              of Paris, died suddenly after a carriage accident. Curie was devastated by his death.

              Yet she continued her research, filling Pierre’s position and becoming the first woman professor at the
              university. In 1911 Curie won her second Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry, for her work with polonium
              and radium. She remains the only person to win Nobel prizes in two different sciences.

              Curie racked up several other accomplishments, from founding the Radium Institute in Paris where she
              directed her own lab (whose researchers won their own Nobels), to heading up France’s first military
              radiology center during World War I and thus becoming the first medical physicist.

              She died in 1934 from a type of anemia that very likely stemmed from her exposure to such extreme
              radiation during her career. In fact, her original notes and papers are still so radioactive that they’re
              kept in lead-lined boxes, and you need protective gear to view them.

              Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day, 1642. Never the humble sort, he would have found the date apt: The
              gift to humanity and science had arrived. A sickly infant, his mere survival was an achievement. Just 23
              years later, with his alma mater Cambridge University and much of England closed due to plague, Newton
              discovered the laws that now bear his name. (He had to invent a new kind of math along the way: calculus.)
              The introverted English scholar held off on publishing those findings for decades, though, and it took the
              Herculean efforts of friend and comet discoverer Edmund Halley to get Newton to publish. The only reason
              Halley knew of Newton’s work? A bet the former had with other scientists on the nature of planetary
              orbits. When Halley mentioned the orbital problem to him, Newton shocked his friend by giving the answer
              immediately, having long ago worked it out.

              Halley persuaded Newton to publish his calculations, and the results were the Philosophiæ Naturalis
              Principia Mathematica, or just the Principia, in 1687. Not only did it describe for the first time how the
              planets moved through space and how projectiles on Earth traveled through the air; the Principia showed
              that the same fundamental force, gravity, governs both. Newton united the heavens and the Earth with his
              laws. Thanks to him, scientists believed they had a chance of unlocking the universe’s secrets.

              Newton’s academic devotion was absolute. His sometime assistant Humphrey Newton (no relation) wrote, “I
              never knew him to take any recreation.” He would only really leave his room to give lectures — even to
              empty rooms. “Ofttimes he did in a manner, for want of hearers, read to the walls,” Humphrey wrote in
              1727. Newton never went halfway on anything.

              It would take too long to list his other scientific achievements, but the greatest hits might include his
              groundbreaking work on light and color; his development and refinement of reflecting telescopes (which now
              bear his name); and other fundamental work in math and heat. He also dabbled in biblical prophecies
              (predicting the world’s end in A.D. 2060), practiced alchemy and spent years trying, and failing, to
              produce the fabled philosopher’s stone. Alas, even Newton’s genius couldn’t create the impossible.

              In 1692, this rare failure, along with the unraveling of one of his few close friendships — and possibly
              mercury poisoning from his alchemical experiments — resulted in what we’d now call a prolonged nervous
              breakdown. Newton’s science-producing days were over, for reasons known only to him, though he would
              remain influential in the field.

              So how did Newton pass his remaining three decades? Remarkably, by modernizing England’s economy and
              catching criminals. After languishing on a professor’s salary at Cambridge University for decades, in 1696
              Newton received a cushy royal appointment to be Warden of the Mint in London. It was meant as an easy job
              with a nice paycheck: It “has not too much bus’nesse to require more attendance than you may spare,” his
              friend Charles Montague wrote after landing him the job. But Newton, focused as ever, threw himself into
              it.

              After a promotion to Master of the Mint, he oversaw the recoinage of English currency, advised on
              economics, established the gold standard and replaced all the country’s metal currency with improved,
              ridged coins (still in use today), which made it harder to shave off bits of the precious metals.

              He also focused his attention on counterfeiters, searching them out as zealously as he sought answers from
              the heavens. Newton established information networks among London’s shadiest spots, even going undercover
              to do so. Counterfeiting was considered high treason, punishable by death, and Newton relished witnessing
              his targets’ executions.

              Newton was known by his peers as an unpleasant person. He had few close friends and never married.
              Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed called him “insidious, ambitious, and excessively covetous of praise, and
              impatient of contradiction.” The man could nurse grudges for years, even after his foes had died.

              He famously feuded with German scientist Gottfried Leibnitz, mainly over who invented calculus first,
              creating a schism in European mathematics that lasted over a century. Newton also made it his life’s work
              to torment English scientist Robert Hooke, destroying the legacy of a man once considered London’s
              Leonardo da Vinci.

              How fitting that the unit of force is named after stubborn, persistent, amazing Newton, himself a force of
              nature.

              Charles Darwin would not have been anyone’s first guess for a revolutionary scientist.

              As a young man, his main interests were collecting beetles and studying geology in the countryside,
              occasionally skipping out on his classes at the University of Edinburgh Medical School to do so. It was a
              chance invitation in 1831 to join a journey around the world that would make Darwin, who had once studied
              to become a country parson, the father of evolutionary biology.

              Aboard the HMS Beagle, between bouts of seasickness, Darwin spent his five-year trip studying and
              documenting geological formations and myriad habitats throughout much of the Southern Hemisphere, as well
              as the flora and fauna they contained.

              Darwin’s observations pushed him to a disturbing realization — the Victorian-era theories of animal
              origins were all wrong. Most people in Darwin’s time still adhered to creationism, the idea that a divine
              being was responsible for the diversity of life we find on Earth.

              Darwin’s observations implied a completely different process. He noticed small differences between members
              of the same species that seemed to depend upon where they lived. The finches of the Galapagos are the
              best-known example: From island to island, finches of the same species possessed differently shaped beaks,
              each adapted to the unique sources of food available on each island.

              This suggested not only that species could change — already a divisive concept back then — but also that
              the changes were driven purely by environmental factors, instead of divine intervention. Today, we call
              this natural selection.

              When Darwin returned, he was hesitant to publish his nascent ideas and open them up to criticism, as he
              felt that his theory of evolution was still insubstantial. Instead, he threw himself into studying the
              samples from his voyage and writing an account of his travels. Through his industrious efforts, Darwin
              built a reputation as a capable scientist, publishing works on geology as well as studies of coral reefs
              and barnacles still considered definitive today.

          <div class="section-p-4" style="color: aliceblue;" >
            <p class="py-5">


              Darwin also married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood, during this time. They had 10 children, and by all
              accounts Darwin was an engaged and loving father, encouraging his children’s interests and taking time to
              play with them. This was a level of attention uncommon among fathers at that time — to say nothing of
              eminent scientists.

              Through it all, the theory of evolution was never far from his mind, and the various areas of research he
              pursued only strengthened his convictions. Darwin slowly amassed overwhelming evidence in favor of
              evolution in the 20 years after his voyage.

              All of his observations and musings eventually coalesced into the tour de force that was On the Origin of
              Species, published in 1859 when Darwin was 50 years old. The 500-page book sold out immediately, and
              Darwin would go on to produce six editions, each time adding to and refining his arguments.

              In non-technical language, the book laid out a simple argument for how the wide array of Earth’s species
              came to be. It was based on two ideas: that species can change gradually over time, and that all species
              face difficulties brought on by their surroundings. From these basic observations, it stands to reason
              that those species best adapted to their environments will survive and those that fall short will die out.

              Though Darwin’s theory was logically sound and backed up by reams of evidence, his ideas faced sharp
              criticisms from adherents of creationism and the religious establishment around the world — just as he had
              feared.

              Although it wouldn’t become widely accepted until the 1930s, Darwin’s theory of natural selection and his
              ideas on evolution have survived largely intact. “I can’t emphasize enough how revolutionary Darwin’s
              theory was and how much it changed people’s views in so short a time,” says Jerry Coyne, professor
              emeritus in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. “On the Origin of
              Species is absolutely thorough and meticulously documented, and anticipated virtually all the
              counterarguments. There’s nothing you can really say to go after the important aspects of Darwin’s
              theory."
